was introduced?

    It helped me a lot!

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more

	Niiceeee..

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

	Its my decision, I can choose better then Google Docs.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

	Because, Git is tracking multiple files that are in relation, and Google Docs is still stupid.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

	Rutinski.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

	I always have plan B, back (undo) option.
